## 📚 Technical Implementation Notes

### Cache Design Principles

**Context-Aware Keys**: 
- Hash based on task type, complexity level, and environmental context
- Include tool availability state in cache key generation
- Consider user context and workflow patterns

**Intelligent Invalidation**:
- TTL-based expiration (configurable, default 5 minutes)
- Confidence-based invalidation when decision confidence drops
- Environment-change invalidation when MCP tools change
- Manual invalidation API for explicit cache clearing

**Memory Management**:
- Configurable cache size limits (default: 1000 entries)
- LRU eviction policy for cache overflow
- Memory usage monitoring and alerting
- Graceful degradation when cache is disabled

### Monitoring Architecture

**Real-time Metrics**:
- Sub-100ms metric collection overhead target
- Asynchronous metric collection to avoid blocking
- Buffered metric storage with periodic flushing
- Configurable metric granularity

**Regression Detection**:
- Automated alerts when performance degrades >10%
- Statistical significance testing for performance changes
- Historical trend analysis for performance patterns
- Integration with CI/CD for automated quality gates
